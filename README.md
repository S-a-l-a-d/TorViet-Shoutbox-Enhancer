<p>The original goal of this script was to simplify the shoutbox but now it aims to provide enhanced experience to the users. This effectively makes it an add-on for the shoutbox.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the new torrents box.</li>
<li>Remove the football betting box.</li>
<li>Remove both the theme and the theme drop-down list.</li>
<li>Remove the warning below the text field.</li>
<li>Center the shoutbox.</li>
<li>Scale the height of the shoutbox to window size on load.</li>
<li>Focus the input field on load.</li>
<li>Add the functionality for the user to choose his own default emoticon groups.</li>
</ul></p>
